# YOLOv8 for KITTI Benchmark 

ðŸš€ **Supercharge your Object Detection on KITTI with YOLOv8!**

Welcome to the YOLOv8_KITTI project. This repository is dedicated to training and fine-tuning the state-of-the-art YOLOv8 model specifically for KITTI dataset, ensuring superior object detection performance.

## Installation

### Set up the python environment

```
conda create -n yolov8 python=3.8
conda activate yolov8
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Set up datasets

#### 1. Set up workspace
Download [KITTI](https://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/eval_object.php?obj_benchmark=3d) dataset and add a link to the data directory. Your datasets path is the disk directory that stores datasets and your project path is current path.
```
ln -s /your/datasets/path/KITTI/data_object_image_2 /your/project/path/data
```

After preparation, you should have the following directory structure: 
```
data/data_object_image_2
|-- training
|   |-- image_2
|   |-- label_2
|-- testing
|   |-- image_2
......
```
   
#### 2. Generate YOLO training label format
We need to modify the original data format to a format suitable for yolov8 training. It will create a `labels_clean` folder, which contains the label files we need.
```
python generate_kitti_4_yolo.py
```
>NOTE: I remove some object labels that didn't meet the conditions, such as the height was too small, the truncation was too serious, the occlusion was too serious, etc.


#### 3. Generate YOLO train/valid file
I handled the training data in advance is divided into about 50% training set and 50% validation set, and is stored in `kitti_splits` folder. Use the following command to generate the files we need in training.
```
python main.py --type preprocess
```
After this, we will get a `train` folder containing training images and labels. A `valid` folder containing valid images and labels. A `kitti.yaml` file used for yolov8 training configuration file. A `kitti_classes.json` file containing Object classes and indexs.

#### 4. Trained model

Download the trained model from [YOLOV8-KITTI](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1JcBUJ1wX43EOcV1ZtJa5eQ?pwd=7wq1) (Pretrained on yolov8x.pt) if you need.

Put it into `./best.pt`.

## Training and Evaluation

### Training
Use the following command to train a object detection model on KITTI. It will download some pretrained model(yolov8x.pt), please wait a minute.
```
python main.py --type train
```
After trained, it will create a `yolov8x-kitti-clean` folder, which contained the training models and some information files.
>Fine-tuning for 50 epoch and 9 batch-size takes about 100 minutes, on our test machine (i5-13600KF CPU, RTX 4070 GPU).



### Evaluation
Use the following command to evaluate a object detection model on KITTI. You can download the trained model from [this section](#4.-trained-model).
```
python main.py --type evaluate --weight your/model/path/best.pt
```

All result files saved in `./runs/detect/val` folder. Following output is the precision, recall, mAP50 and mAP50-95 data on the validation set.
```

### Prediction
Use the following command to predict the test set on KITTI using the trained model. You can download the trained model from [this section](#4.-trained-model).

```
python main.py --type predict --weight your/model/path/best.pt
```
All result images and labels saved in `./runs/detect/predict` folder.
